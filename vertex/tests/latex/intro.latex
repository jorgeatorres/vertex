\title{A short example of how to use \latex for scientific reports}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The purpose of this short document is to provide a brief overview of
  the facilities that \latex offers for formatting scientific reports.
  Furthermore, the source files for regenerating this report are
  freely available so that users can easily start writing their own
  reports using \latex.
\end{abstract}



\section{Introduction}

\latex is a typesetting program; given an input file with formatting
instructions (e.g intro.tex), the program will create your document in
one of several formats (typically PDF, but also DVI or Postscript).
It is therefore not a WYSIWYG word processor.  \latex is known as a
logical markup language, similar for example to HTML, so that you
describe a piece of text as a ``section heading'' rather than saying
that it should be formatted in a certain way.  It has excellent
facilities for typesetting mathematics, and handles large documents
(such as theses) well.  The aim of this document is not to provide an
overview of \latex, since many other guides have already been written
(see Section~\ref{sec:summary}).  Instead, it has been written
primarily to provide simple workable examples that you can cut and
paste to help you get started with \latex.  The examples have been
selected to be those most likely to be useful when writing a
scientific report.  This document is best read by comparing the source
code with the resulting output.

\section{Running \latex}

The files to accompany this paper are at:
\url{http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/eglen/texintro}.  Get the
following files and put them into a new directory.


\begin{enumerate}
\item \url{intro.tex}: the main \latex document.
\item \url{example.bib}: a short bibliography.
\item \url{sigmoid.ps}: example postscript image.
\item \url{sigmoid.pdf}: example PDF image.
\end{enumerate}

Change directory to where you stored the files and type the
following (ignoring comments placed after \#\#):

\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex intro                  ## Run latex 1st time.
bibtex intro                    ## Extract required references
pdflatex intro                  ## Run latex 2nd to resolve references.
pdflatex intro                  ## Probably need to run latex a 3rd time.
xpdf intro.pdf                  ## View the resulting PDF
\end{verbatim}

You will notice that you run latex several times here; this is so that
references can be resolved, and references can be extracted from your
bibtex file.  After running latex, you will be told if you need to run
it again to resolve references.  After a while, you will get the idea
of how many times you need to run latex to resolve all your
references.  

Recent versions of latex may have the command texi2pdf, in which case
you can do just:

\begin{verbatim}
texi2pdf intro.tex
xpdf intro.pdf
\end{verbatim}

and pdflatex will be run repeatedly until your document is compiled.

These instructions assume you are running in a unix environment.
There are GUI environments for other platforms:

\begin{itemize}
\item Mac: \url{http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/}
\item Windows: miktex; Cambridge users can try
\url{http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/internal/computing/faq-win/tex/miktex.html}.

\item Cross platform:  \url{http://www.tug.org/texworks/} (not yet ready)
\end{itemize}

\section{Tables}

Tables are relatively straightforward to generate.  Note that tables
and figures are not always placed exactly where you wish, as
they can \textit{float} to other parts of the document.  Rather than
trying to battle with \latex as to where they are placed, concentrate
first on getting the right content and let \latex worry about the
positioning.  Instead, use labels to your tables to refer to them.
See Table~\ref{tab:simple} and Table~\ref{tab:pars} for examples.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|r|rr|}
    \hline
    year & min temp (C) & max temp (C)\\ \hline
    1970 & -5 & 35\\
    1975 & -7 & 29\\
    1980 & -3 & 30\\
    1985 & -2 & 32\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Fictional minimal and maximal temperatures recorded in
    Cambridge over several years.}
  \label{tab:simple}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}\\ \hline
              & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\phi$ (um)}
              & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\alpha$}
              & $\delta_{12}$ (um)\\ \hline
    W81S1\\
    $h_{11}(u)$  & 67.94 & 7.81\\
    $h_{22}(u)$  & 66.27 & 5.40\\
    $h_{12}(u)$  &       &     &18\\
    \hline
    M623\\
    $h_{11}(u)$  &112.79 &  3.05\\
    $h_{22}(u)$  & 65.46 &  8.11\\
    $h_{12}(u)$  &       &      &20\\
        \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Summary of parameter estimates for the univariate
    functions $h_{11}(u)$, $h_{22}(u)$ and the bivariate function
    $h_{12}(u)$.  For the univariate fits, $\alpha$ and $\phi$ are 
    least-square estimates (assuming $\delta$ was fixed at 15 um).
    The final column gives the
    maximum likelihood estimate of $\delta_{12}$ assuming that the
    interaction between types is simple inhibition.
    \label{tab:pars}}
\end{table}


\section{Bibliography management}

Scientific reports normally require a section where your references
are listed.  Bibtex is an excellent system for maintaining references,
especially for large documents.  Each reference needs a unique key;
you can then refer to the reference in your \latex document by using
this key within a cite command.

Take care when formatting your references, especially when it comes to
writing authors names and the case of letters in journal titles.  In
our examples, the files are found in \url{example.bib}.  As an example
of a citation, see \citep{ihaka1996} or \citep{ihaka1996,venables1999}.

Bibtex is flexible enough to format your references in a wide number
of different styles to suit your needs.  In this file I have used the
``natbib'' package, which is suitable for the natural sciences.
Depending on the type of cite command you get (and the package that
you use for citations), you can get different styles of citation.  See
Table~\ref{tab:cite} for some examples.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    command & result\\ \hline
    \verb+\citep{ihaka1996}+ & \citep{ihaka1996}\\
    \verb+\citet{ihaka1996}+ & \citet{ihaka1996}\\
    \verb+\citep[see][p. 300]{ihaka1996}+ &
    \citep[see][p. 300]{ihaka1996}
    \\
    \verb+\citeauthor{ihaka1996}+ & \citeauthor{ihaka1996}
    \\
    \verb+\citeyear{ihaka1996}+ & \citeyear{ihaka1996}
    \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Examples of different citation commands available in the
    natbib package.}
  \label{tab:cite}
\end{table}


\section{Graphics}
\label{sec:graphics}

\latex can include images in one of several format, depending on
whether you use latex (postscript format required) or pdflatex (either
jpeg, png or pdf required).  Figures can be included either at their
natural size, or you can specify e.g. the figure width.
Figure~\ref{fig:example} shows an example image which intentionally
looks slightly different depending on whether you compile the document
with latex or pdflatex.  Note that in this example the suffix of the
image file is not included so that this document compiles under both
latex and pdflatex.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=6cm]{sigmoid}
  \caption{Example of a sigmoidal curve generated by the R programming
    environment.  The title above the curve indicates whether you have
  included the postscript or the pdf version of the figure.}
  \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\section{Mathematics}

\latex can format mathematics with ease, either in line, such as 
$x \times y$, or on separate lines, such as:

\[ x^2 +y^2 = z^2 \]

If you are writing several lines of equations, you can use statements
like the following:

\begin{eqnarray}
  b(t) & = & s(t) - \int_{0}^{T} a(t') \cdot i(T-t') dt'
  \\
  a(t) & = & \int_{0}^{T} b(t) \cdot e(T-t') dt' \label{eq:am}
  \\
  g(t) & = & b(t) \ast e(t) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

By using labels on certain equations, we can refer to equations by
number, such as equation~(\ref{eq:am}).

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
This short guide should give you a flavour of what can be done with
\latex.  It is by no means complete, or supposed to be
self-explanatory.  It is, however, hopefully enough to get you
started!  Try experimenting by editing the source file and then
recompiling this document.  As mentioned earlier, there are many
guides for latex.  Two that I can recommend are
\url{http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/index.html} and 
`` The (Not So) Short Introduction to LaTeX2e''
(\url{http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}).
